    <h1>Bold and Italic text Practice</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>This is going to be bold</strong> and this will be regular.
      <em>Now this will be Italic</em>. Pretty nice right! now there is also
      something called the <i>'i' text</i>
      <!-- <em> stands for emphasis. and <strong> makes my text strong. There is something called semantics which is the reason why we don't uses <b> or <i>. There is no meaning behind these. Do not use these. -->
